dnsbrute.sh: This script does bruteforce by direct query in dns server for a specific domain <br>
isup.sh: Is useful for mapping intranet hosts by icmp echo requests (remember, only hosts that answer for icmp will be "up", but a host can be up but filtering icmp", this program generates a log file where you can use together with dnsrecon and dnsbrute <br>
dnsrecon: This script is focused in reverse dns enumeration looking by names from a specific dns_server ( it uses the output (log) from isup ) <br>
BralSpider.rb is a script that search for links in href tags in page, that's a good idea if you want enumeration javascript and pages that doesn't appear in page directly,this tool does what I proposed but still in development <br>
